# Afterlife Garden - Project Documentation

In this project, we are exploring the possibilities in rethinking the way we interact with our loved ones who have passed away.

## Key objectives

We want to design an interactive device that helps to:
- Let users interact with each family membersâ€™ item, reminisce their lives, and remember intimate moments
- Educate the younger family members of their family history and heritage

## Project detail

Afterlife Garden is an interactive device to help children understand and better connect to beloved family members who have passed away.

How to use the device:
1. Place the miniature urns into their slots
2. The device will sense the touch and trigger the lights to go around and land at the slot
3. The LED screen will then show the photograph and life story of the family member assigned to that slot
4. The speaker will also automatically play their favorite song

Device components and parts used:
- Physical device
    - Laser cut cardboard
    - Hot glue
    - Physical device
    - Acrylic paint
    - Tree branch
    - Origami paper
    - Scissors
- Sensors and electronics
    - Raspberry Pi
    - Neopixel light strip
    - LED screen
    - Capacitive sensor
    - Alligator clips (5)
    - Copper tape
    - Servo Control â€“ Micro Servo Motor SG51 and Qwiic Servo Controller
    - Battery pack (3)
    - Speaker
    - Connecting wires

**Sketching the design and mood board:**

We initially came up with the idea to have a tree-like structure and have the device placed on the wall. However we discovered that tabletop arrangement will be easier for children to interact with.

We iterated our design and came up with the final sketch of the device before proceeding to prototype it with the laser-cutting machine

We then proceed to test which color schemes work best to evoke the right emotion.

# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.

# Final Project Idea

In this project, we are exploring the possibilities in re-thinking the way we interact with our loved ones who have passed away.

## Key objectives

We want to design an interactive device that helps to:
- Let users interact with each family membersâ€™ item, reminisce their lives, and remember intimate moments
- Educate the younger family members of their family history and heritage

The idea is still in exploratory stage and we are going to experiment many ways in forming the product.

**Possible parts**
- Cardboard (prototyping)
- Display screen
- Proximity sensor (possibly)
- LED light (possibly)
- MQTT ðŸ˜Š

**Key risks**
- Product does not evoke the intended emotions
- Users find it difficult to set up
- Designed interactions are not intuitive enough

In the case we face challenging constraints, we would consider the following fallback plans:
- Make it for commercial use instead in columbariums
- Switch to our secondary idea about educational game
