![Project Plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6238480/207645261-6cedadfb-3a29-4c45-9d6c-b8ec1f9fc2d0.jpg)

Our initial plan was to design to rethink the topic of death. For example, to build a new way for people to interact with the deceased at the temple or graveyard. However, as we discussed more along the design process, we got inspiration from the movie Coco. 

“He’s been forgotten. When there’s no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the final death.” 

We want to make the memory of the deceased long-lasting, and therefore we designed our final project - Afterlife Garden. 

The key objectives of our project include:
- Let users interact with each family members’ item, reminisce their lives, and remember intimate moments
- Educate the younger family members of their family history and heritage
 
## Description
Afterlife Garden is an interactive device for educational purpose. The goal is to design on the topic of death to help children understand and better connect to and remember the beloved family members who have passed away.

- Physical device
    - Laser cut cardboard
    - Hot glue
    - Acrylic paint
    - Tree branch
    - Origami paper
    - Scissors
    - Mobile Phone

**Design Process**

- Discussion of the physical form
   - After deciding on the idea, we ideated our project's physical form. At first, we wanted the final product to look like a family-tree structure. 
   - We initially came up with the idea to have a tree-like structure and have the device placed on the wall. However we discovered that tabletop arrangement will be easier for children to interact with.
   - We iterated our design and came up with the final sketch of the device before proceeding to prototype it with the laser-cutting machine

- Laser cut the physical interface
  - We used laser cut to cut out a pond shape, sticked two top layers together to form thickness, and cut out a bendable pattern as the support to connect the top two layers with the bottom one while leaving some empty space in the middle for devices.

- Test out different parts of sensors
  - We worked on individual sensors first before putting everything together
  - Below are the videos showing us testing for light strip, servo motor, and capacitive sensor

**Capacitive Sensor**

- Color and physical design
  - As we believe that it is important that our product evoke the right emotions from our users, we make sure to test different color schemes to be painted on the top layer of the device.

We decided to go with the Coco-inspired color scheme and move forward to assembling the different components together

## Open Studio Day 2022

[Open Studio](https://openstudiofall2022.splashthat.com/) is an event held at Cornell Tech for presentations and demos by students, faculty, PhDs, and others in the Cornell Tech community, giving people a closeup view of the real-world products being built here.

We managed to talk to many visitors who were very intrigued and inspired with the concept and execution of our product. One visitor even told us that the project reminds her of the [empty phone booth for Japan's 2011 Tsunami survivors](https://www.insider.com/japans-tsunami-survivors-call-lost-loves-phone-of-the-wind-2021-3).

Here is the final setup of our table for people to interact directly with our device

We also created a highlight video to help promote the device in our setup

## Group work distribution questionnaire

On this project, we worked together on lasercutting and painting the physical interfaces. Brian was responsible for the color theme and painting of the top layer. Sylvia was responsible for doing laser cutting and paint components as well as the tree. For the technical part, Brian worked on Servo Motor and light strip. Sylvia primarily worked on P5Serial Server and websocket to connect mobile interface with the entire device. Both Brian and Sylvia worked on Capacitive sensor (Brian on connecting sensor with light, Sylvia on connecting sensor with P5SerialServer to receive and update date) and music player. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire


## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.

**Key risks**
- Product does not evoke the intended emotions
- Users find it difficult to set up
- Designed interactions are not intuitive enough

In the case we face challenging constraints, we would consider the following fallback plans:
- Make it for commercial use instead in columbariums
- Switch to our secondary idea about educational game
